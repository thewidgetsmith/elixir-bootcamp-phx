# Workspace

**TODO: Add description**

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `workspace` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:workspace, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/workspace](https://hexdocs.pm/workspace).



Debugging Elixir is an example repository for my article Debugging Phoenix and Elixir Applications in Visual Studio Code

To test the project, clone the repository onto your computer and run the mix tasks using visual studio code.
